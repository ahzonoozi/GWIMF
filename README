GWIMF - a tool to compute a galaxy wide initial stellar mass function based on the IGIMF theory 
(see, e.g., Weidner et al. 2013; Kroupa et al. 2013).
It is a FORTRAN code that allows to compute the galaxy-wide initial stellar mass functions based on IGIMF theory for different adopted star formation rate or metallicity.

                                                                               
Developed by Akram Hasani Zonoozi at (Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences)
in collaboration with Pavel Kroupa;

This reference should be used for any publications that utilize GWIMF.

COMPILING THE CODE:

For compiling the IGIMF use the Makefile by simply typing:
 
> make

You may have to edit the Makefile so that it is using your FORTRAN compiler one should then be able to compile it.

IGIMF can be run from the command line:

> ./GWIMF.out

Would give a galactic wide IMF based on addopted star formation rate (SFR), metalicity (Fe/H) and initial mass function (IMF).

---------------------------------------------------------------------
INPUT:

This script needs an input file including:

SFR: the star formation rate in [M_{sun}/yr]
FeH: Fe/H value.
nx: Number of bins for "star" masses 
mx: Number of bins for "embedded cluster" masses
and IMF parameters:
M_L=0.08    : lower limit of stellar mass in [M_{sun}] 
M_turn1=0.5 : first mass at which the power-law index of the IMF changes from alpha_1 to alpha_2  
M_turn2=1.0 : second mass at which the power-law index of the IMF changes from alpha_2 to alpha_3 
M_U=150     : upper limit of stellar mass
a_1=1.3 and a_2=2.3 are the power-law index of the canonical IMF.

TYPE_IGIMF  :1,2,3 ( different IGIMFs which are explained in the "MANUAL.pdf" file )

an example input file is available
---------------------------------------------------------------------
SUBROUTINES:


MAX_Mecl.f90 : 
calculate the maximum cluster mass based on adopted SFR.


MAX_MSTAR.f90 :
Calculate the maximum stellar mass for each cluster.


MASS_FUNC.f90 :
calculate the number of stars in mass bins (IGIMF), dN/dm.



---------------------------------------------------------------------
OUTPUT:

1-The output filename corresponds to the adopted SFR and Fe/H like 
"SFR1.0E-05FeH-5.0.txt" for SFR=1.0E-5 and Fe/H=-5.0
Therefor it is  necessary to enter these values in the same format as illustrated in the example INPUT file.

Outputs include the IGIMF as a function of stellar mass:
# mass[M_{sun}],   
# IGIMF_M, the number of stars in mass bins (dN/dm) normalized to one solar mass 


2-For  comparison the Canonical IMF is also calculated and printed to the "Canonical-IMF.txt" file:
# mass[M_{sun}],   
# IMF_M, the number of stars in mass bins (dN/dm) normalized to one solar mass 

 
3-"mmax-Mecl.txt" file includes the maximum-stellar-mass (m_{max}) as a function of the embedded-cluster-mass 
(M_{ecl}) up to the maximum embedded cluster mass which is generated:
# M_{ecl}
# m_max
